# MachineLearningFramework
machine learning framework originally created for SYSC3110 term project (Fall 2017). This program's purpose is to estimate values for new data points, given old data that the user has inputted via a GUI. 

The original project used a kNN classification algorothim to predict values and contained basic UI for maniputlating the model. Recent updates by me (starting Winter 2019) have made a number of changes:

- [x] vastly improved abilities and organization of the GUI
- [x] allowed saving/loading of multiple problem sets at specified pathnames
- [x] refactored model for better and more consistent design
- [x] general refactoring of code to greatly reduce code duplication
- [x] increased the number of distance metrics available to use for predictions
- [x] introduced genetic algorithm to the project to allow the distance metrics and weightings to be optimized

***run MachineLearningFramework.java to run the GUI
