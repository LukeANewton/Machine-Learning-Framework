***run runMe.java to run the non GUI code and see some examples run

***run MachineLearningFramework.java to run the GUI 

This project contains a simple machine learning framework. This program's purpose is to estimate values for new data points, 
given old data that the user has inputted via a non-graphical UI.

running runMe.java will run both the house pricing example and the soccer example that were given in class, once with each point distance function we have provided to show difference in predictions.
